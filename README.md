# useful_linux_scripts
My ongoing collection of useful linux shell scripts

This is where i place just about any Linux shell script that I find interesting, useful and may want to use later

Some of them are extremely basic and I use them as a simple way to remember how to do something.

if they look useful to you too, clone and enjoy!
