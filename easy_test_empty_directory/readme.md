This is a simple test script to determine if a directory exists and whether it is empty or not

It takes in command line arguments and processes them as directories

- if the argument is a directory that doesn't exist, it will output 'doesn't exist'
- if the argument is a directory but its empty, it will output "exists and is empty"
- if the argument is a directory but its not empty, it will output "exists and is not empty"

Note:  all tests are done with directory test commands.   The script does not test for files specifically.
