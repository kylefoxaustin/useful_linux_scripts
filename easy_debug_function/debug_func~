# set this global variable to determine if debug messaging is on or off
# DEBUGON=1 -> indicates that debug messaging is off
# DEBUGON=0 -> indicates that debug messaging is on

DEBUGON=1

# debug function
# this function simmply returns the value of DEBUGON

debug () {
      return $DEBUGON
      }

# how it is used
# if you want to turn messaging on, set DEBUGON=0 above
# write your normal command but place debug && "your message" above it
# for example:
#      my script has the following command:   source ~/.bashrc
#      I want to be able to tell when I am about to run that command
#      via a console message
# to do that:
#    1: debug && echo "about to execute source ~/.bashrc"
#    2: source ~/.bashrc
#
# if global DEBUGON=1 then the test debug && echo "text" will not execute
# since DEBUGON=1=FALSE.  Therefore the command echo "text" will not occur
#
# if global DEBUGON=0 then the test debug && echo "text" will execute
# since DEBUGON=0=TRUE.

# test the function here:

debug && echo "about to run ls -l command"
ls -l
